# The Carbon Shifters

Now you can start reducing your carbon footprint!

You can either do it yourself (link) or have others do it for you. Be ready to pay them! (link) 
You can also help others to get started (link) or build your own gasifier device (link).

## Gasification with TLUD gasifiers

Cooking on TLUDs leaves behind charcoal (mostly carbon) which has been removed from the athmosphere by trees (or plants in general).

## Burying the charcoal... 

... removes it from the biocycle, and the atmosphere, for hundreds if not thousands of years. Most "Climate Projects"  merely try to slow down the rise of carbon dioxide...

## this one reduces it's level.
