# The Carbon Shifters

are burying carbon, and now you can start reducing your carbon footprint, too!

You can either do it yourself (link) or have others do it for you. (link) 
You can also help others to get started (link), build your own gasifier device (link), sponsor building classes, ...

## Gasification with TLUD gasifiers 

Cooking on TLUDs (what's a TLUD? link) leaves behind charcoal (mostly carbon) which has been removed from the athmosphere by trees (or plants in general).

## Burying the charcoal... 

... removes it from the biocycle, and the atmosphere, for hundreds or thousands of years. Most "Climate Projects"  merely try to slow down the rise of carbon dioxide...

## this one reduces it's level.
