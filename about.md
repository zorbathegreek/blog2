Plants use photosynthesis to remove CO2 from the atmosphere and build biomass, and to produce the oxygen we need and use. Carbon Shifters use this biomass by NOT _burning_ it but by _gasifying_ it. About half the carbon is captured as charcoal that way. We deposit the resulting char in the soil (link Terra preta), and hence invert the effects of _burning_ fossil oil, gas and coal. This is the only practicable way to semi-permanently bring the additional carbon from fossil fuel back into the ground. 

Cooking on gasifers is easy, and even though some of the carbon is not thermally used, it is still more effective than a wood fire. Other industries can follow this example: Bakeries, brick factories, even power generation. 



Reasons:
- its great.
- its a test.

## Other thoughts

This is great.
