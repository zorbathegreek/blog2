**Plants** have a great ability: they use photosynthesis to **remove CO2** from the atmosphere, to **build biomass**, and to produce the oxygen we use to breathe, and to keep our industries and vehicles running. Carbon Shifters **use this biomass** by NOT _burning_ it but by **_GASIFYING_** it, because about half the carbon is captured as charcoal that way and **NOT released back into the atmosphere!** 

We **deposit** the resulting char in the **soil** (link Terra preta), and hence **invert the effects of _burning_ fossil oil, gas and coal**. This is the only practicable way to bring the additional **carbon from fossil fuel back into the ground**, for hundreds or thousands of years (link).

Cooking on gasifers is easy, and even though some of the carbon is not thermally used, it is still more effective than a wood fire. Other industries can follow this example: Bakeries, brick factories, even power generation. 



Reasons:
- its great.
- its a test.

## Other thoughts

This is great.
