We use the brilliant ability of **plants** to use photosynthesis and **remove CO2** from the atmosphere while building their biomass, and to produce the oxygen we use to breathe, and to keep our industries and vehicles running. 

Carbon Shifters prevent **about half of the carbon that is contained in that biomass** to escape back into the atmosphere by the use of **_TLUD-GASIFIERS_**  (link) to produce socalled woodgas to cook food (link), smoke-free, and produce charcoal at the same time. We are disrupting the natural carbon cycle; to counterbalance the problematic excess use of fossil fuel. 

Charcoal is a stable material (link), a good ion-exchanger (link), and holds back three times its weight of humidity (link); it greatly improves the properties and fertility potential of soil. That's why we **deposit** the resulting char in the **soil** (link Terra preta), and hence **INVERT the effects of burning fossil oil, gas and coal**.

2 to 3 billion people cook on wood and charcoal; many if not most of them could switch to cook on woodgas. Some have already started through our efforts (links). 

Other industries could follow this example: bakeries, brick factories, even power generation facilities. You could be producing bread, bricks or power, AND charcoal, for sanitation and agriculture. Extra, clean and green business!
