The Carbon Shifters benefit from the brilliant ability of **plants to remove CO2** from the atmosphere while building their biomass, and gasify it in TLUD devices (link), to use about half of that **C** for energy, for example to cook food on woodgas (link), and turn the rest of it into charcoal, to keep it **out of the atmosphere** for good, , **inverting the effects of burning oil, gas and coal**. 

Charcoal greatly improves the properties and the fertility potential of many soil types; it is a good ion-exchanger (link), has a large inner surface, and holds back about three times its weight of humidity (link). That's why we **reinsert** the char into the **soil** (link Terra preta) That way, we correct the problematic use of fossil fuel and the disrupted natural carbon cycle. 

Billions of people cook on wood and charcoal today, depleting natural wood sources; many could switch to cooking on woodgas. Some have already started through our efforts (links). But other industries could follow: bakeries, brick factories, even power generation facilities, and more. They could be producing bread, bricks, power, ... and charcoal, for sanitation and agriculture, as an extra, clean and green business!

#### If you are busy or involved into one of these industries, don't hesitate to join us! (link)
