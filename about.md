The Carbon Shifters use the brilliant ability of **plants to remove CO2** from the atmosphere while building their biomass. We use about half of that C for energy, for example to cook food on woodgas (link), and turn the other half into charcoal by gasificaton, **keeping it out of the atmosphere**. TLUD devices (link)

Charcoal greatly improves the properties and the fertility potential of soil; it is a stable material (link), a good ion-exchanger (link), and holds back about three times its weight of humidity (link). That's why we **reinsert** the char into the **soil** (link Terra preta), **inverting the effects of burning oil, gas and coal**. That way, we correct the problematic use of fossil fuel and the disrupted natural carbon cycle. 

Billions of people cook on wood and charcoal today, depleting natural wood sources; many could switch to cooking on woodgas. Some have already started through our efforts (links). But other industries could follow: bakeries, brick factories, even power generation facilities, and more. They could be producing bread, bricks, power, ... and charcoal, for sanitation and agriculture, as an extra, clean and green business!

##If you are busy or involved into one of these industries, don't hesitate to join us! (link)
