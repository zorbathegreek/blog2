The Carbon Shifters benefit from the brilliant ability of **plants to remove CO2** from the atmosphere while building their biomass, which we gasify in TLUD devices (link), to use about half of that **C** for energy, to cook food on woodgas etc. (link), and turn the rest of the biomass into charcoal, to **keep that C out of the atmosphere***, which is in fact the **inversion of burning oil, gas and coal**. 

Charcoal greatly improves the properties and the fertility potential of many soil types; it is a good ion-exchanger (link), has a large inner surface, and holds back about three times its weight of humidity (link). That's why we produce Terra Preta (link)  and **reinsert** the char back into the **soil**. That way, we correct the problems from the use of fossil fuel, and fix the disrupted natural carbon cycle. 

Billions of people cook on wood and charcoal today, depleting natural wood sources; many could switch to cooking on woodgas. Some have already started doing that through our efforts (links). But other industries could follow: bakeries, brick factories, even power generation facilities, and more. They could be producing bread, bricks, power, ... and charcoal, for sanitation and agriculture, as an extra, clean and green business!

#### If you are busy or involved into one of these industries, don't hesitate to join us! (link)
