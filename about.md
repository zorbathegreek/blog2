The Carbon Shifters use the brilliant ability of **plants to remove CO2** from the atmosphere while building their biomass. We prevent **about half of that C** to escape back into the atmosphere by the use of **_TLUD-GASIFIERS_** (link) for example to cook food on woodgas (link), and produce charcoal at the same time. 

Charcoal is a stable material (link), a good ion-exchanger (link), and holds back about three times its weight of humidity (link); it greatly improves the properties and fertility potential of soil. That's why we **deposit** the char in the **soil** (link Terra preta), and hence **INVERT the effects of burning fossil oil, gas and coal**. That way, we counterbalance the problematic use of fossil fuel, by correcting the disrupted natural carbon cycle. 

2 to 3 billion people cook on wood and charcoal; many could switch to cooking on woodgas. Some have already started through our efforts (links). 

Other industries could follow: bakeries, brick factories, even power generation facilities, and more. They could be producing bread, bricks or power, AND charcoal, for sanitation and agriculture. Extra, clean and green business!

##If you are busy or involved into one of these industries, don't hesitate to join us! (link)
